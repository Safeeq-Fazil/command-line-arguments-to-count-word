# command-line-arguments-to-count-word
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
## Step 1:
Import sys module

## Step 2:
Open the file with sys.argv[1]

## Step 3:
Use the for loop to select the content in file

## Step 4:
Use split function to to separate the file content into words or strings

## Step 5:
Count the length of the words using len

## Step 6:
Print the number of words

## PROGRAM:

import sys
fp=open(sys.argv[1],'r')
count=0
for line in fp:
    list1=line.split()
    count+=len(list1)
print("Number of words in a file",count)
```

### OUTPUT:
